Individual users can access the service. The next step is to integrate corporate users. We could already win our first customer who provides his **own Identity Provider (IdP)**. You are asked to enable users from that organization to login to our application using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

We do this in two steps:

1. Allow authenticating users from **external Identity Providers (IdP)** such as Okta.
2. Enable Auth0 Organizations to **better manage B2B customers and enhance the user experience**.
