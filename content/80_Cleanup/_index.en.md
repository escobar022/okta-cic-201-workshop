If you used this Workshop for learning purposes and not for production you should always delete the created resources after youâ€™re through all the steps.

1. If you used your own AWS Account with the Cloud9 IDE, delete it or costs will incur.
2. The Auth0 Login is public available. For a full cleanup of Auth0, delete the Auth0 Tenant.
